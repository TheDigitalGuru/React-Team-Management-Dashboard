I made this React Dashboard following the tutorial originally presented to me on YouTube by Ed Roh: 

His github repository is slightly different than mine and can be found here: <br />
https://github.com/ed-roh/react-admin-dashboard.git


His YouTube tutorial can be found here: <br />

You can launch this app from this link here: <br />

(Note: I'm having trouble getting the profile to work with how github pages compiles this code, but a simple demonstration is what I wanted to provide for you.)

I will be completing the functionality of this code soon on a new branch otherwise. 
Stay tuned, and happy coding!
